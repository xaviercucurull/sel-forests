# Combining multiple forest classifiers
PW2 for MAI SEL Spring 2021. Implementation of a Random Forest and a Decision Forest.

The objective of this exercise is to implement, compare and validate two combinations of multiple classifiers: a random forest and a decision forest.
The implemented Random Forest [1] and Decision Forest [2] will be compared and evaluated in several domains.
